        <strong>Concave Mirror</strong>
      </h2>

      <p>
        Concave mirrors have the reflecting surface that bulges inward. They are
        also called converging mirrors because it converges all parallel beam of
        light incident on it. Unlike a flat mirror, concave mirrors can form
        real images that are projected out in front of the mirror at the place
        where the light focuses. Concave mirrors can be used in satellite
        dishes, vehicle headlights, astronomical telescopes and many more areas.

      </h2>

      <p>
        The equation connecting the distance between mirror and object (u),
        distance between mirror and image (v), and the focal length of the
        mirror (f) is called mirror formula.

        <strong>Focal length by graphical method</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>From u-v graph :</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We can measure the focal length of the given concave mirror graphically
        by plotting graph between u and v. For this, plot a graph with u along X
        axis and v along Y axis by taking same scale for drawing the X and Y
        axes. A curve is obtained. The point at which the bisector meets the
        curve gives the radius of curvature (R).
      </p>

      <p>
        Now focal length can be calculated from the relation,{' '}
        <strong>R = 2f.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>From 1/u â€“ 1/v graph :</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We can also measure the focal length by plotting graph between 1/-u and
        1/v. Plot a graph with 1/u along X axis and 1/v along Y axis by taking
        same scale for drawing the X and Y axes. The graph is a straight line
        intercepting the axes at A and B.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The focal length can be calculated by using the relations,{' '}
        <strong>OA=OB= 1/f.</strong>
      </p>
