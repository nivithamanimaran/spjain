      <p>Boys, girls, cows, birds, trees, books, pens.</p>

      <p>Thus there are two Numbers in English-the Singular and the Plural.</p>

      <p>boy: boys , pen: pens , girl: girls , desk: desks</p>

      

      <p>

          the singular
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>class : classes , dish: dishes , box: boxes</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          Most Nouns ending in -o also form the plural by adding -es to the

        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>buffalo: buffaloes , potato: potatoes</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>A few nouns ending in -o merely add -s,</strong>
      </p>

      <p>dynamo: dynamos , logo: logos , commando: commandos</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          Nouns ending in -y, preceded by a consonant, form their plural by
          changing -y into -i and adding -es
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>baby: babies , lady: ladies , city: cities</p>

      

      <p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          The nouns dwarf, hoof, scarf and wharf take either -s or -ves in the
          plural.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>dwarfs or dwarves;</p>

      <p>hoofs or hooves;</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>Other words ending in -f or -fe add -s</strong>
      </p>

      <p>chief: chiefs , safe: safes , proof: proofs</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          A few nouns form their plural by changing the inside vowel of the
          singular
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>man: men , woman: women , foot: feet , mouse: mice</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          There are a few nouns that form their plural by adding -en to the

        scissors, tongs, pincers, spectacles, trousers, drawers, jeans, alms,
        annals
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>mathematics, physics, news ,measles</p>

      

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          A Compound Noun generally forms its plural by adding -s to the
          principal word
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>Commander-in-chief : Commanders-in-chief</p>

      <p>Son-in-Law : Sons-in-law</p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          Collective nouns denote a group of people, objects, ideas, or animals
          as a single concept. Though the collective noun refers to more than
          one in a group, the noun itself is considered a single thing.
        </strong>
      </p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          The singular verb and pronoun form is used is if they are acting in
          unison. For example:
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The class listens [singular verb form] carefully to its [singular
        pronoun] teacher's instructions. (Here the class is a unit acting
        together as one. They are all doing the same thing, listening, at the
        same time.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          When the members of the group are acting on their own, use the plural
          verb and pronoun forms. For example:
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The class start [plural verb form] their [plural pronoun] projects while
        the teacher grades their [plural pronoun] papers. (The class is a unit,
        but they act individually when they work on their own projects.)
      </p>

      

      <p>
        <strong>Examples of collective nouns:</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Army , Audience , Band , Board , Cast , Class , Flock of birds , Pride
        of lions
      </p>

      

      

      <p>
        <strong>
          While making Sentences Subjects and verbs must AGREE with one another
          in number (singular or plural). Thus, if a subject is singular, its
          verb must also be singular; if a subject is plural, its verb must also
          be plural. Refer the activity of Subject Verb agreement. The rules of
          Subject Verb agreement are :

      </p>

      <p class="P1">
        <span class="T1">Basic Rule.</span> A singular subject (she, Bill, car)
        takes a singular verb (is, goes, shines), whereas a plural subject
