          Metals are elements and are good conductors of heat and electricity.
          Most metals are electropositive in nature and the metal atoms lose
          electrons in chemical reactions to form cations. The more reactive a
          metal, the greater tendency it has to form a positive ion in a
          chemical reaction.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <h2 className={classes.secondaryTag}>How are metals arranged in a periodic table?</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Metals occupy the bulk of the periodic table.</strong> The
        alkali metals are a series of chemical elements in the periodic table.
        Alkali metals comprise group 1 in the periodic table along with
        hydrogen. Alkali metals are lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K),
        rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs) and francium (Fr).{' '}
        <strong>
          The group 2 elements in the periodic table are called alkaline earth
          metals.
        </strong>{' '}
        Alkaline earth metals are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg) calcium (Ca),
        strontium (Sr), barium (Ba) and radium (Ra). Group1 and group 2 elements
        are together called <strong>s-block elements</strong>. Elements of group
        3 to 12 are<strong> transition elements.</strong> These are also
        metallic in nature and are called <strong>transition metals</strong>.
        They are also called d-block elements.
        <strong>
          {' '}
          Non-metallic elements occupy the right side of the periodic table.{' '}
        </strong>
        A diagonal line from boron to polonium separates metals from non-metals.

      <h2 className={classes.secondaryTag}>Now, let’s explore the properties of metals…</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Physical properties of metals:</strong>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Good conductors of heat and electricity: In metals, the positive ions
          are surrounded by a sea of electrons and these are responsible for
          their conductivity.
        </li>
        <li>High melting point and boiling point.</li>
        <li>
          They are malleable and ductile, so they can be bent and stretched
          without breaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          In most metals, the atoms are highly close packed, so they have high
          density.
        </li>
        <li>They have a shiny appearance.</li>
        <li>
          Metals exist in solid state at room temperature except for mercury,
          which is in a liquid state at room temperature.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Chemical properties of metals:</strong>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A more reactive metal readily reacts with other elements. The most
          reactive metals will react even water, while the least reactive metals
          will not react even with acid.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Example: If we put a small piece of sodium metal in water, sodium&nbsp;
        reacts exothermically with water producing hydrogen and metal hydroxide.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe3} />{' '}
        &nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>Metals react with oxygen in the air to form oxides.</p>

      <p>Examples:</p>

      <p>
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe4} />
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Some metals react with acid and replace hydrogen from the acid.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>
          &nbsp;
          <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe5} />

        &nbsp;
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Single displacement reactions:</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>
          A single displacement reaction is an important type of chemical
          reaction. It is also called substitution reaction. In these reactions,
          a free element displaces another element from its compound, producing
          a new compound.
        </strong>{' '}
        The reaction is usually written as:
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe6} />
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Single displacement reactions are all oxidation-reduction reactions
        </strong>
        . For example,
      </p>

      <p>
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe7} />
        &nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Definition of Displacement reaction: </strong>{' '}
        <strong>
          The chemical reaction by which one element takes the position or place
          of another element in a compound
        </strong>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        Displacement reactions are very common in metals. They can be used to
        find out the relative reactivities of metals. In a displacement
        reaction, a more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from
        its salt solution. The reaction is often known as metal displacement
        reaction.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the commonly used metals have been arranged in the decreasing
        order of reactivity. This is known as the{' '}
        <strong>reactivity series</strong> <strong>or activity series</strong>.
        The activity series of metals is an important concept in chemistry. The
        activity series of metals is an important tool for predicting the
        products of displacement reactions and the reactivity of metals in other
        reactions. Potassium is the most reactive metal,&nbsp; while platinum is
        the least reactive.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe8} />
        &nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The higher the metal in the series, the more reactive it is and the more
        vigorously it reacts with water, oxygen and acid.&nbsp; A metal in the
        activity series can displace any metal below it in the series from its
        compound. The elements potassium, sodium, lithium and calcium are very
        reactive and they react with cold water to produce hydroxides and
        hydrogen gas. The elements magnesium, aluminium and iron are also
        considered as active metals and they react with steam to produce oxides
        and hydrogen gas. The metals above hydrogen are more reactive than
        hydrogen. These metals can displace hydrogen from acids or water and
        liberate hydrogen gas. The metals copper, silver gold and platinum are
        less reactive than hydrogen and they do not replace hydrogen from water
        or acid.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>Examples for metal-displacement reactions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Zinc can displace copper from copper sulphate solution and iron from
          ferrous sulphate solution. So zinc is more reactive than iron and
          copper.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        &nbsp;
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe9} />
        &nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a piece of
        zinc metal is added to aluminium sulphate solution, no reaction takes
        place. So aluminium is more reactive than zinc.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If small pieces of copper are added into solutions of zinc sulphate,
          aluminium sulphate and ferrous sulphate, no reactions take place. So,
          copper is less reactive than zinc, aluminium and iron.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aluminium can displace Zn from zinc sulphate solution, Cu from copper
          sulphate solution and Fe from ferrous&nbsp;sulphate solution.
        </li>
      </ul>

        &nbsp;
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe11} />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Iron displaces Cu from copper sulphate solution, but it does not
          displace Al and Zn from their salt solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <img alt="" src={SaltSolsThe12} />
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only metals but also non-metals can take part in displacement
        reactions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, chlorine gas displaces bromine from potassium bromide
        solution. The solution of potassium bromide acquires a yellowish and
        orange color of the liberated bromine gas.&nbsp;
      </p>
